<h3 id="headline">Here's a short biography of Betty Holberton's life:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frances Elizabeth Holberton</strong> was born on March 7, 1917 in Philadelphia, United States. She decided to study mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania because of her vocation, but in the face of misogynistic comments from one of her professors urging her to stay at home raising children, she decided to change to journalism, one of the university careers open to women at that time.</li>
<li>
During World War II, due to the lack of men in the country because of the conflict, the U.S. Army hired women to work on calculating ballistic trajectories, which were initially calculated by hand. In this way, Betty was accepted along with many other women like Kathleen McNulty by the Moore School of Engineering to work as computers or ‘human computers’ for the US Army, considered as “sub-professionals”.
</li>
<li>
Shortly thereafter, she was selected – along with five other women mathematicians – to develop a pioneering program: the first electronic computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer (ENIAC). The ENIAC was secretly used during the early years of the conflict to calculate the trajectories of nuclear missiles being built at Los Alamos National Laboratory and was capable of performing 5000 additions and 300 multiplications per second thanks to the work done by these women.
</li>
<li>
During her work on the development of UNIVAC I by designing the control console and its computer and numeric keyboards, Betty wrote the first generative programming system and the first statistical analysis package, which would be used in the first U.S. census in 1950.
</li>
<li>
In addition, she contributed to the development of the C-10 instructions for BINAC, now considered the prototype for all modern programming languages. Related to this field of study, he also participated in the writing of the first standards for COBOL and FORTRAN together with Grace Hopper.
</li>
In 1997, she became the only woman of the six who had contributed to the programming of the ENIAC to receive the Ada Lovelace Award, one of the most prestigious awards in the field of programming, as well as the IEEE Computer Society’s IEEE Computer Pioneer Award. In the same year, the six ENIAC programmers were inducted into the Women in Technology Hall of Fame as a token of recognition for their work almost 50 years earlier.
<li>
Due to their influence in the world of programming, there is currently an institution called Holberton School, which exists in several countries and has graduated professionals who are currently working for large technology companies such as Tesla or Google.
